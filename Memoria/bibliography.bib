    abstract = {A recurrent problem in generating realistic pictures by computers is to represent natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as “fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot.The value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

abstract="Advances in computer graphics allow to simulate ever growing virtual worlds with a higher level of realism which can even be created in real time. An integral part of these worlds are the terrains which are the physical features of the land. Despite the capabilities of modern computer systems, the creation process still demands high amounts of man-hours. To automatically generate coherent, realistic-looking and useful content is still and open problem, and research focuses on how to automatize these processes while allowing users to exert a certain degree on control over the generated content. This survey goes over the different techniques used for the automatic generation of terrains, which include different land formations such as mountains, valleys, rivers, shores, etc. These terrains have different uses such as simulation or entertainment which translates on different needs over the desired realism of the terrain and the degree of control that users have. Through time, different approaches have been proposed: repeating patterns that resemble those seen in nature; using software agents that imitate geological processes; using artificial intelligence techniques for pattern recognition and imitation of landscapes; or allowing users to interact with the system to draw desired terrain features. This review presents an overview of the area and discusses how different techniques adapt to the different needs and different stages of terrain creation.",

abstract = {Abstract Terrain generation methods have long been divided between procedural and physically-based. Procedural methods build upon the fast evaluation of a mathematical function but suffer from a lack of geological consistency, while physically-based simulation enforces this consistency at the cost of thousands of iterations unraveling the history of the landscape. In particular, the simulation of the competition between tectonic uplift and fluvial erosion expressed by the stream power law raised recent interest in computer graphics as this allows the generation and control of consistent large-scale mountain ranges, albeit at the cost of a lengthy simulation. In this paper, we explore the analytical solutions of the stream power law and propose a method that is both physically-based and procedural, allowing fast and consistent large-scale terrain generation. In our approach, time is no longer the stopping criterion of an iterative process but acts as the parameter of a mathematical function, a slider that controls the aging of the input terrain from a subtle erosion to the complete replacement by a fully formed mountain range. While analytical solutions have been proposed by the geomorphology community for the 1D case, extending them to a 2D heightmap proves challenging. We propose an efficient implementation of the analytical solutions with a multigrid accelerated iterative process and solutions to incorporate landslides and hillslope processes – two erosion factors that complement the stream power law.},

This paper presents the first method in computer graphics that combines uplift and hydraulic erosion to generate visually plausible terrains. Given a user-painted uplift map, we generate a stream graph over the entire domain embedding elevation information and stream flow. Our approach relies on the stream power equation introduced in geology for hydraulic erosion. By combining crust uplift and stream power erosion we generate large realistic terrains at a low computational cost. Finally, we convert this graph into a digital elevation model by blending landform feature kernels whose parameters are derived from the information in the graph. Our method gives high-level control over the large scale dendritic structures of the resulting river networks, watersheds, and mountains ridges.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30m cell−1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.}

abstract = {We report two studies that investigate the use of subjective believability in the assessment of objective realism of terrain. The first demonstrates that there is a clear subjective feature bias that depends on the types of terrain being evaluated: Our participants found certain natural terrains to be more believable than others. This confounding factor means that any comparison experiment must not ask participants to compare terrains with different types of features. Our second experiment assesses four methods of example-based terrain synthesis, comparing them against each other and against real terrain. Our results show that, while all tested methods can produce terrain that is indistinguishable from reality, all also can produce poor terrain; that there is no one method that is consistently better than the others; and that those who have professional expertise in geology, cartography, or image analysis are better able to distinguish real terrain from synthesized terrain than the general population, but those who have professional expertise in the visual arts are not.},
