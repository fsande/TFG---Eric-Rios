\chapter{Case Study: Recognition of road and urban infrastructures in Tenerife} \label{chap:Results}
Con este título u otro, este debiera ser el capítulo "central" del trabajo.

This chapter is a case study for the automatic recognition of roads and urban infrastructures in Tenerife using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and deep learning architectures. The study evaluates six state-of-the-art segmentation models, analyzing both their performance metrics and computational efficiency in a real-world scenario representative of the Canary Islands' diverse geographic conditions.
Figure \ref{fig:efficiency_analysis_tesla} shows the same analysis performed on a Tesla V100 GPU, which represents a significant improvement in computational capabilities. The Tesla V100 demonstrates substantially faster training times, with most architectures completing training in under 20 minutes, representing a 40-50\% reduction compared to the Quadro M4000. The inference performance also shows notable improvements, with inference times consistently below 15 milliseconds. This GPU shows a balance between training efficiency and inference speed.
